# Optimizing-Marketing-Campaign-Performance

### About the Project

This project explores a hypothetical marketing campaign for the launch of *"Classic Men's Jeans,"* aimed at capturing the attention of young men aged 18-24. The company, targeting the mid-range market segment, allocates **$5,000** for a campaign spread across multiple digital channels. The goal is to identify the most effective strategies by focusing on:

- Maximizing **conversion rates**
- Optimizing **ROI**
- Expanding the **customer base**

Using data analytics, this project evaluates different campaign and channel combinations, aiming to provide actionable insights to guide budget allocation and maximize overall campaign performance.
